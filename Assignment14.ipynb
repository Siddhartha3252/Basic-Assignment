    "1. What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : RGBA stand for red, green, blue, and alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : We can get RGBA value of any image using function called ImageColor.getcolor('CornflowerBlue', 'RGBA') will return (100, 149, 237, 255), the RGBA value for that color.\n",

    "3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : A box tuple is a tuple value of four integers: the left edge x-coordinate, the top edge y-coordinate, the width, and the height, respectively.\n",
    "                                          \n",
    "                                          Left: The x-coordinate of the leftmost edge of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "                                          Top: The y-coordinate of the top edge of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "                                          Right: The x-coordinate of one pixel to the right of the rightmost edge of the box. This integer must be greater than the left integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "                                          Bottom: The y-coordinate of one pixel lower than the bottom edge of the box. This integer must be greater than the top integer.\n",

    "4. Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an\n",
    "Image object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : We can find by imageObj.size is a tuple of two integers, the width and the height.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left\n",
    "quarter of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : By using imageObj.crop((0, 50, 50, 50)). And here we are passing a box tuple to crop(), not four separate integer arguments.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : We can save it by Call the imageObj.save('new_filename.png') method of the Image object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : It caontains the code to draw on images.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind\n",
    "of object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : ImageDraw objects have shape-drawing methods such as point(), line(), or rectangle().\n",
    "                                 They are returned by passing the Image object to the ImageDraw.Draw() function.\n",
